His father used to be a tea vendor, serving tea in the local offices to sustain a family of four. Growing up under adverse circumstances, Bumba successfully passed both his Madhyamik and H.S Examinations, and then opted to study History in Kharagpur College. He obtained a first class in his bachelor’s and then joined Jadavpur University in 2015, when his father was suddenly afflicted with a cerebral stroke. His right arm was paralysed and he also lost his speech. To save his family from starvation, Bumba had to set up a makeshift stall in the local market on holidays and weekends. He also started giving private tuitions. As the crisis deepened he was unable to pay his hostel fees and was almost reduced to an abject hand to mouth existence. Srijan Sujan came to Bumba’s aid in the midst of such dire straits. He is now in the second year of his master’s and we hope Bumba completes his M.A successfully and creates a bright future for both himself and his family. </p>\r\n",
